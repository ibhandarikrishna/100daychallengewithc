problem -- Tocheck wether a string is palindrom or not.
language used -- Java.
solution --
In this program we used two strings the first one is to take input from user the another one will store
the reverse order of the first string. we have also used toUppercase function in order to pass over test
cases this function will convert any lowercase string to upper case.And after converting to upper case
we used string.equals() function to compare both  the string if they match then the program will show 
a message that "The string is palindrom"
if they do not matches it will show a message that "Entered string is not palindrom".
This program works fine on the integer type input and  also works fine on special characters.

input --
raar
output -
Entered string in upper case is : 
RAAR
RAAR
Entered string is palindrom.

complexity --
Time complexity - O(n)
space complexity - O(1)
